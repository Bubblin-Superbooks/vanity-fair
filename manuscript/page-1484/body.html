Don't be FRIGHTENED if I don't bring you in your COFFY. Last night as I was coming home smoaking, I met with an ACCADENT. I was NABBED by Moss of Cursitor Street—from whose GILT AND SPLENDID PARLER I write this—the same that had me this time two years. Miss Moss brought in my tea—she is grown very FAT, and, as usual, had her STOCKENS DOWN AT HEAL.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It's Nathan's business—a hundred-and-fifty—with costs, hundred-and-seventy. Please send me my desk and some CLOTHS—I'm in pumps and a white tye (something like Miss M's stockings)—I've seventy in it. And as soon as you get this, Drive to Nathan's—offer</p></div> </div>
