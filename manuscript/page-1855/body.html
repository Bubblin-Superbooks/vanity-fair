Major Dobbin, if you please not to break my scissors." The Major was twirling them round by the little chain from which they sometimes hung to their lady's waist, and was thereby endangering his own eye.</p><p>"It is a woman whom I dislike very much," said the Major, doggedly, "and whom you have no cause to love."</p><p>"It is Rebecca, I'm sure it is Rebecca," Amelia said, blushing and being very much agitated.</p><p>"You are right; you always are," Dobbin answered.
